For Magento 2.3 and later.

## What is Login as Customer

Login as customer is a module that allows your sales assistant, or any other administrative person with required permissions, to login in to the store's customer account so it's easy to the sales assistant to assist the customer with the sales process.

## Why use our Login as Customer extension?

There are times when your customer may need some help to select products, add them to the shopping cart and finish the order, for instance. Or any other problem that could happen to him.

This module exists for the reason of letting the sales assistant to login to the customer's panel without asking for the customer's password, which might cause some problem if the customer's security was compromised.

This module can be very handy to help your customers.

## Features

This module includes the following features:

- Login as Customer funcionality (in the customer grid and in the customer edit page on admin);
- Specific permission options to allow only some admin roles to access this funcionality;
- Secure login process from the backend panel to frontend panel;

## Installation

You can download this module and install it direct in your Magento `app/code` directory but I really recomend you to install using `composer` installation process described bellow.
